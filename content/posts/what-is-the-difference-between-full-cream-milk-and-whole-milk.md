Milk is a staple in many households and is used for a variety of purposes, from drinking to cooking and baking. With so many options available in the dairy aisle, it can be confusing to understand the difference between different types of milk. Full cream milk and whole milk are two popular options, but what exactly sets them apart from each other? In this article, we will take an in-depth look at the differences between full cream milk and whole milk.

## Definition of full cream milk and whole milk

Full cream milk, also known as full-fat milk, is a type of milk that has a higher fat content compared to other milk varieties. It is made from milk that has not been skimmed or had any of the cream removed.

Whole milk, on the other hand, is a type of milk that contains a minimum of 3.25% milk fat. Unlike full cream milk, whole milk has not undergone any processing or had any of the cream removed.

## Importance of understanding the difference between the two

Knowing the difference between full cream milk and whole milk is important for several reasons.

Secondly, the fat content of milk can also affect the nutritional value, making it important to choose the right type of milk for your specific needs.

### 1\. Fat Content

The main difference between full cream milk and whole milk is their fat content.

The difference in fat content between full cream milk and whole milk also affects the nutritional value of the milk. Full cream milk is higher in calories and fat compared to whole milk, making it a better choice for those who need to gain weight or have a higher calorie intake. Whole milk, on the other hand, is a lower calorie option for those watching their weight or who have a lower calorie intake.
