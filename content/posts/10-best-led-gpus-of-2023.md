* HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY—-The thermal tape made of acrylic polymer which filled with heat conductive ceramic powder and silicone adhesive compound and into. Thermal adhesive tape has high thermal conductive and insulating properties, its life is longer than the general heat-dissipating double-sided sticker, and it can work for at least 5 years at normal temperature (80-120°C ).
* WIDELY APPLICATION—-The double side thermal tape featuring electrically insulated , thermally conductivity and strong adhesion is ideal for Heatsink, LED Strips, IGBT, IC Chip, Computer CPU, GPU, Modules, MOS Tube, SSD Drives. This is a must have product for electronics enthusiasts.
* MEET ROHS & UL THE ENVIORMENT —-The heatsink tape has high thermal conductivity 1.5 W/m-k to meet most of electronics heat dissipation demands. The thermal tape with excellent flexibility can use in uneven surface. Heat sink tape with high reliability and thermal conductivity has excellent flexibility, adhesion, self adhesive and high compressibility can replace the hot melt adhesive, screw, fastener for fixing mode.
* EASY TO USE—-Stick on surface of any object and tear the blue release paper, which can be tightly and firmly conglutinate on the heat source devices and heat sink to speed the heat dissipation. Just need to press it slightly, this adhesive tape sticks incredibly well and works right away, no curing time. Once applied, you do not need to apply it again as it will last at least for 5 years.
