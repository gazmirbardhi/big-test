If there are enough reviews with bad ratings (less than 3 stars), it’s probably not worth buying that product.

### Look at the price

This may seem obvious, but it’s important not to just look at how much something costs and decide that it’s too expensive. Instead, you should compare prices between different sellers and see which offers more value for money!
