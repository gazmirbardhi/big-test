### Definition of Summary

A summary is a brief overview of the main points of a longer work. It condenses the content of a book, article, or any other text into a shorter form while retaining its essence. A summary is meant to provide a quick and concise overview of the content without going into too much detail. 

The purpose of a summary is to give readers an idea of what the original work is about without having to read it in its entirety.

### Definition of Synopsis

A synopsis, on the other hand, is a detailed summary of the plot, characters, and themes of a story. Unlike a summary, a synopsis is meant to provide an in-depth understanding of the story and its elements. A synopsis typically includes a brief summary of the story’s beginning, middle, and end, as well as the main characters and their motivations, conflicts, and relationships. 

The purpose of a synopsis is to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the story, including its narrative arcs and important plot points.
