Cream is a dairy product that is essential in the kitchen for cooking and baking. It is a versatile ingredient that is used in various dishes and desserts. Heavy cream and thickened cream are two commonly used creams, but many people do not know the difference between the two. 

In this article, we will discuss the difference between heavy cream and thickened cream, including their characteristics, uses, and fat content.

## Heavy Cream

Heavy cream, also known as heavy whipping cream, is a dairy product that has a high fat content of 36% or more. This type of cream is made from the fat and milk solids of cowâ€™s milk. It is characterized by its smooth and velvety texture and its ability to whip into stiff peaks.

### Characteristics of Heavy Cream:

* High fat content (36% or more)
* Smooth and velvety texture
* Whips into stiff peaks

### Uses of Heavy Cream:

* In cooking and baking as a thickening agent
* As a base for sauces and soups
* In whipped cream for desserts

### Fat Content of Heavy Cream:

The fat content of heavy cream is around 36% or more, making it a rich and creamy ingredient. The high fat content makes it ideal for cooking and baking as it adds flavor and richness to dishes.

## Thickened Cream

Thickened cream, also known as pouring cream, is a type of cream that has a lower fat content of 18-30%. It is made by thickening regular cream with stabilizers and thickeners, such as gelatin, cornstarch, or carrageenan. The result is a cream that has a pourable consistency and is ideal for use in sauces and gravies.

### Characteristics of Thickened Cream:

* Lower fat content (18-30%)
* Pouring consistency
* Ideal for use in sauces and gravies

### Uses of Thickened Cream:

* In sauces and gravies
* In soups and stews as a thickener
* In coffee or tea as a creamer

### Fat Content of Thickened Cream:

Thickened cream has a lower fat content of 18-30%, making it a lighter alternative to heavy cream. The lower fat content makes it a healthier option for those who are conscious about their calorie intake. However, it is important to note that the lower fat content also results in a lack of richness and creaminess compared to heavy cream.
