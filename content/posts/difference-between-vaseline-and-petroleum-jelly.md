Vaseline and petroleum jelly are two popular and widely used skin care products. Many people are confused about the difference between the two, and it is often assumed that they are the same thing. However, there are some significant differences between the two products, which are important to understand.

## Definition of Vaseline and Petroleum Jelly

Vaseline is a brand of petroleum jelly, which is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons with a melting point of around 25Â°C. It is commonly used as a moisturizer and skin protectant. Petroleum jelly was first discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a young chemist, while drilling for oil in Pennsylvania.

## Purpose of Vaseline and Petroleum Jelly

The main purpose of both vaseline and petroleum jelly is to provide a protective barrier for the skin and to help keep it moisturized. They are commonly used to treat dry skin, minor cuts and burns, chapped lips, and to help with skin conditions like eczema. They work by sealing in moisture and creating a barrier to prevent the skin from losing moisture, thus keeping it hydrated and healthy.

## A brief history of Vaseline and Petroleum Jelly

Petroleum jelly was first discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a young chemist, while drilling for oil in Pennsylvania. He discovered that the residue from the oil drilling process had healing properties, and he began to market the product as petroleum jelly. The Vaseline brand was later established by Chesebrough, and it remains one of the most popular brands of petroleum jelly today.
