A surname and a last name are often used interchangeably, however, there is a difference between the two. Understanding the difference between the two terms is crucial, especially when it comes to genealogy and personal identity. In this article, we will delve into the definitions, history, and usage of each term and highlight the key differences between them.

## Definition of Surname

A surname is a family name passed down from generation to generation. It is a surname that identifies a person as a member of a particular family and is usually inherited from one’s parents. In most cultures, a surname is usually the second name of a person, following the first name or given name.

## History and Origin of Surname

The practice of using surnames dates back to ancient civilizations, such as the Roman Empire. In these societies, a surname was used to differentiate between people with the same first name and to identify individuals as members of a specific family or clan. Over time, the use of surnames spread to other cultures and became a widespread practice.

## Usage and Custom in different cultures

In some cultures, such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, a person’s surname is made up of two parts: the father’s surname and the mother’s surname. In these cultures, the father’s surname is usually listed first, followed by the mother’s surname. In other cultures, such as English, German, and Scandinavian, a person’s surname is usually a single name that is passed down from the father.

## Definition of Last Name

The term “last name” is commonly used in English-speaking countries and is used to refer to a person’s surname. A last name is the name that appears last in a person’s full name and is often used to identify a person as a member of a particular family.

## Historical development and origin of Last Name

The use of last names or surnames has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. In Europe, the use of last names became widespread during the Middle Ages and was used to identify individuals as members of a specific family or trade. The practice of using last names spread to other countries and cultures through colonization and immigration.

## Usage in different cultures and countries

In some countries, such as the United States, last names are usually a single name that is passed down from the father. In other countries, such as China and Korea, a person’s last name is usually a single name that is shared by many people and does not change from generation to generation. In some cultures, a person’s last name is a combination of the father’s and mother’s last names.
