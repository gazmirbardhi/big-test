Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by the presence of blisters or sores on the skin that are filled with pus and have a yellow or honey-colored crust. On the other hand, herpes is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can cause outbreaks of painful blisters or sores on the skin.

## Importance of Understanding the Difference between the Two
