##  dual link graphic cards: Tips for Buying Online Safely

Online shopping has become a part of our everyday lives. The convenience of purchasing items from anywhere at any time is hard to beat. But it’s not all roses and sunshine. There are some real concerns when buying dual link graphic cards from online:

### 1\. Use a Secure Wifi or Internet Connection

Although it is comfortable and easy to browse and buy through public networks, malls or stores, the truth is that these networks are often unreliable. Hackers and cybercriminals can easily capture the information packets transmitted over public connections. For this reason, we recommend you go through a secure network to make purchases or transactions in which you transfer personal information.

### 2\. Keep Your Computer Updated and Protected

Online shopping is one of the processes in which more personal and dangerous information is transferred. Therefore, before shopping, ensure your computer is secure, updated and equipped with a good antivirus product.

### 3\. Buy on Known and Reputable Websites

Searching the internet for the best offers can take you to the unknown and unreliable. Stay away from them. Check that the URL of the web site matches where you think it is, and its address begins with https. Shopping at trusted and reputable websites can prevent identity theft or data victims.

### 4\. Find and Review Privacy and Return Policies

Before buying from an online store, ensure that their Privacy Policy is easily located on the site and up to date. Do you know what to do if your gift is not right? How can you return it? These are also aspects to consider when choosing where to shop.

### 5\. Only Share Personal Information That is Necessary and Only on a Secure Form

If it surprises you that they ask you for some personal information (mobile, relatives’ name, place of birth …) to carry out the purchase, do not do it, and it checks that you are in the correct place. In addition, tools such as the virtual keyboard of Panda Security can avoid data theft if your computer is infected with some virus spyware.

### 6\. Avoid Links in Emails and Ads

Is the offer you received in an email too good to be true? Then, it probably is. During this time of year, e-mails and ads with offers and big discounts are a tool widely used by cybercriminals. Avoid phishing.

### 7\. Periodically Check Your Credit Card Transactions

After making several purchases online, check that all charges on your account are known and controlled. If you find any suspicious activity, contact your bank. Maybe you’ve been a victim of identity theft.

The key is finding a good brand that offers quality and value for your purchase. When choosing a good brand, critical considerations include customer reviews about their products, warranty policy, how long they’ve been around, and what other customers have said about their service record. We hope this post may help you narrow down your search so that now making an informed decision on which one to buy should be much easier!
