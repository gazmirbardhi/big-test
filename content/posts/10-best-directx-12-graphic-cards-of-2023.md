### 1\. Use a Secure Wifi or Internet Connection

### 5\. Only Share Personal Information That is Necessary and Only on a Secure Form

If it surprises you that they ask you for some personal information (mobile, relatives’ name, place of birth …) to carry out the purchase, do not do it, and it checks that you are in the correct place. In addition, tools such as the virtual keyboard of Panda Security can avoid data theft if your computer is infected with some virus spyware.

### 6\. Avoid Links in Emails and Ads

Is the offer you received in an email too good to be true? Then, it probably is. During this time of year, e-mails and ads with offers and big discounts are a tool widely used by cybercriminals. Avoid phishing.
