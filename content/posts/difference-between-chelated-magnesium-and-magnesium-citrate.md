Magnesium is a vital mineral for your body, but it can be hard to get enough of it in your diet. That’s why many people turn to magnesium supplements to meet their daily needs. But with so many types of magnesium supplements on the market, it can be hard to know which one is best for you. 

The two most popular types of magnesium supplements are chelated magnesium and magnesium citrate. But what’s the difference between these two? Chelated magnesium is a form of magnesium that has been bound to an amino acid, making it easier for your body to absorb. 

Magnesium citrate, on the other hand, is made from citric acid and magnesium carbonate, and is more easily absorbed by the body than chelated magnesium. Ultimately, the choice between chelated magnesium and magnesium citrate comes down to personal preference. 

If you’re looking for a supplement that’s easy to absorb, then magnesium citrate is the better choice. But if you’re looking for a supplement that has more of a slow release effect, then chelated magnesium may be the better option.

## What is Chelated Magnesium?

Chelated magnesium is a type of magnesium supplement that is bound to an amino acid, making it easier for the body to absorb. It is a popular supplement among athletes and those looking to improve their overall health. Magnesium is an essential mineral for the body, playing a role in over 300 biochemical processes. 

It is necessary for muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, energy production, and bone health. Unfortunately, many people are deficient in magnesium due to poor dietary choices, stress, and inadequate absorption. Chelated magnesium is a form of magnesium that is bound to an amino acid, making it easier for the body to absorb. 

It is more bioavailable than other forms of magnesium, meaning that it is more readily absorbed by the body. This makes it especially beneficial for those with digestive issues or those who have difficulty absorbing other forms of magnesium. 

The benefits of taking chelated magnesium include improved energy levels, better sleep quality, improved muscle and nerve function, improved bone health, reduced stress levels, and improved cognitive function. It is also beneficial for those who suffer from headaches, migraines, and muscle cramps. 

When shopping for a chelated magnesium supplement, look for one that contains other essential minerals such as calcium, potassium, and zinc. These minerals work together to provide the body with the nutrients it needs to function optimally. 

Chelated magnesium is an excellent supplement for those looking to improve their overall health and well-being. It is important to speak with a doctor before taking any supplements to ensure that they are safe and effective for you.

## What is Magnesium Citrate?

Magnesium citrate is a compound of magnesium and citric acid, which is used as a dietary supplement and to treat certain medical conditions. It is available over-the-counter in both liquid and pill form. Magnesium citrate is used to treat constipation, indigestion, and other gastrointestinal issues. 

It works by increasing the amount of water in the intestines, which helps to soften the stool and make it easier to pass. It also helps to reduce symptoms of indigestion and heartburn. Magnesium citrate can also be used to treat conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and premenstrual syndrome.

It helps to reduce muscle spasms and pain, as well as improve mood and energy levels. In addition to its medicinal uses, magnesium citrate is also used as a dietary supplement. It can help to improve bone health, reduce the risk of stroke, and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It can also help to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 

Magnesium citrate is generally considered safe for most people. However, it can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. It should be taken with caution if you have kidney problems or are taking medications that affect the kidneys.
